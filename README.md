it is Hangman game 

this game gives us letters to guess the corect word
it is fun to play 

I used python language to create this game 
 
this is how it works :

* Initialize a list of fruit words.
* Randomly select one word.
* Display underscores for each letter.
* Allow the user to input letters :
       If the letter is correct, reveal it.
       If incorrect, reduce chances.
* Continue until the word is guessed or chances run out.
* Display win/lose message.
